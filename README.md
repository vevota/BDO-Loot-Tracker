# BDO Loot Tracker

An open source, real-time loot tracking overlay for **Black Desert Online**. It watches your loot pickups via OCR, parses item names and quantities against a known CSV item list.

## Linux / Wayland

This fork adds native Wayland support using `grim` + `slurp` (replaces `mss`).

### Dependencies (Arch Linux)

```bash
pacman -S tesseract grim slurp \
          python-pillow python-pytesseract python-dotenv python-pystray python-requests
```

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vevota/BDO-Loot-Tracker
cd BDO-Loot-Tracker
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy env and edit your character name
cp env.example .env
# Run calibration to set the capture region
python main.py --calibrate
# Start the tracker
python main.py
```

### Calibration (Wayland)

1. Run `python main.py --calibrate`
2. Click and drag to select the area where loot notifications appear
3. Press Space/Enter to confirm and test OCR
4. Press Enter again to save

Alternatively, skip the GUI and manually edit `.env` with `REGION_LEFT_PCT`, `REGION_TOP_PCT`, etc.

## Windows

### Dependencies (Windows)

**Tesseract OCR** - [Download here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

Control Panel → Edit the system environment variables → Advanced → Environment Variables → Edit Path (under User Variables) → New → `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`

A debug image is saved to `helpers/calibration_debug.png` for verification.

## Desktop UI

The tracker UI runs as a standalone desktop window (powered by `PySide6`) while still being served locally from `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in the background.
